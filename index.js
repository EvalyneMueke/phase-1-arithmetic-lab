// Write your code here

//the answer must be 64 so we have use constant numbers that willgive us 64 
//that is 31 and 2
const num1 = 31;
const num2 = 2;
let multiply = num1 * num2;


//The number we are generating is random so math.ceil a random one
let random = Math.ceil(Math.random());

//the remainder should be 4

const num3 = 65;
const num4 = 14;
let mod = Math.floor(num3/num4);

//65/14 the answer 4.6 so to get the exact answer being 4 we can Math.trunc(mod);

let max = Math.max(5,9,13,20);
